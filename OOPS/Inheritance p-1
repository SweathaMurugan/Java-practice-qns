Write a Java program to create a class called Vehicle with a method called drive(). 
Create a subclass called Car that overrides the drive() method to print "Repairing a car"



class Vehicle{
    public void drive(){
        System.out.println("Repairing a vehicle");
    }
}
class Car extends Vehicle{
    @Override
    public void drive(){
        System.out.println("Repairing a Car");
    }
}
class Demo{
    public static void main(String[]args){
        Vehicle v = new Vehicle();
        v.drive();
        Car c = new Car();
        c.drive();
        
    }
}


OUTPUT:
Repairing a vehicle
Repairing a Car
