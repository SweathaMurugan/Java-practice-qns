 Write a Java program to create a class known as "BankAccount" with methods called deposit() and withdraw(). 
Create a subclass called SavingsAccount that overrides the withdraw() method to prevent withdrawals if the account balance falls below one hundred.


class BankAccount{
    protected double balance;
    public void deposit(double amount){
        balance += amount;
        System.out.println("Deposited amount:"+amount);
    }
    public void withdraw(double amount){
        balance -= amount;
        System.out.println("Withdraw amount:"+amount);
    }
    public double getbalance(){
        return balance;
    }
}
class SavingsAccount extends BankAccount{
    @Override
    public void withdraw(double amount){
        if(balance-amount<100){
            System.out.println("Insufficient balance");
        }
        else{
            balance-=amount;
            System.out.println("Withdrawal amount:"+amount);
        }
    }
    
}
class Demo {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        SavingsAccount sa= new SavingsAccount();
        sa.deposit(900);
        System.out.println("Current Balance:"+sa.getbalance());
        sa.withdraw(850);  
        System.out.println("Current Balance: " + sa.getbalance());
        sa.withdraw(200);
        System.out.println("Current Balance: " + sa.getbalance());
        
    }
}

OUTPUT:
Deposited amount:900.0
Current Balance:900.0
Insufficient balance
Current Balance: 900.0
Withdrawal amount:200.0
Current Balance: 700.0
